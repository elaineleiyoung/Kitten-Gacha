# Kitten-Gacha
### Inspiration
We were inspired by our mutual interest in mobile apps, specifically Genshin Impact, and our shared passion for social and public health and well-being.

### What it does
Kitten Contact is a mobile IOS app that encourages users to increase the number of steps they take by allowing users to adopt one of 6 kittens of different tiers for every 2000 steps they take. Following the gacha system, the higher tier the kitten is, the more challenging it will be to obtain it. As a result, we hope to encourage users to walk more in order to maximize their chances of obtaining a rarer kitten.

### How we built it
We used XCode as an IDE to build our IOS app using SwiftUI and photoshop for our graphics.

### Challenges we ran into
A challenge we ran into was figuring out how to calculate distance of a user since calculating from point A to point B is actually calculating displacement, so we used the number of steps of a user. Another challenge we encountered was implementing our pictures into our app.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that our app functionally working and we worked together to create an app that we collectively wanted to build.

### What we learned
We learned the foundation of Swift and how to implement HealthKit, a framework that uses data from the Health App, into our app.

### What's next for Kitten Contact
We hope to create more kittens for users to collect and to improve the user interface and user experience. Specifically, we hope to add animations for 5 star kittens. We also want to incorporate the food and water into a more interactive experience for the user by allowing users to feed and water their kittens.
